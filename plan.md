make a single page HTML app that uses the ffmpeg web assembly to
shrink a video file to be under 10mb in size once exported so
that it can fit in the discord 10MB file size limit.

prioritize functionality over aesthetics. no need for fancy styling
or drag and drop. basic input boxes and a verbose log of what is going on
displayed on the page.
